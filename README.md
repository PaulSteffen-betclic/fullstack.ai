# fullstack.ai

End-to-end machine learning project showing key aspects of developing and deploying real life machine learning driven application.

## POC

* EDA, data manipulation an preparation
* Scraping additional features from external sources
* Iterative process of building ML model
* Wrapping it as Python module as transition from dev colab notebooks to prod code
* Using this module in Flask based microservice
* Contenerizing it with Docker, orchestring with Kubernetes and deploying on Google Cloud

This basically covers full ML tech stack at the moment (maybe besides online learning, but thats for other time).

I'll be using [SF Bay Area Bike Share](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share) dataset to model duration of bike travel across San Francisco. This dataset is bit dated and task itself is probably bit banal, but hey, this project is all about tech stack and leveraging different tools and ml techniques to achive my goal - a web based ml driven bike trip advisor with trip time prediction.

## WIP
This project will take a while ...
